# CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
This project created an app for Airgead Banking to help students understand investment growth through compound interest. Users can input their investment amount, interest rate, and time period to see how their investment grows over time.

What did you do particularly well?
I effectively used object-oriented programming to break the project into manageable classes like Investment and CompoundInterest. The code is modular and easy to extend, and I ensured user input validation to prevent invalid entries.

Where Could You Enhance Your Code? How Would These Improvements Make Your Code More Efficient, Secure, and So On?
I could enhance input validation by adding more comprehensive checks, like ensuring interest rates and time periods are within reasonable ranges. This would improve security and prevent incorrect calculations.

Which Pieces of the Code Did You Find Most Challenging to Write, and How Did You Overcome This? What Tools or Resources Are You Adding to Your Support Network?
The compound interest calculation was challenging to get right. I reviewed financial formulas and tested the program with various inputs to ensure accuracy, while also adding financial resources and C++ documentation to my support network.

What Skills from This Project Will Be Particularly Transferable to Other Projects or Coursework?
The skills I developed in object-oriented design, user input validation, and financial calculations will be useful in future projects, especially those that involve similar logic or algorithms. Breaking problems into smaller tasks is a transferable skill across all programming tasks.

How Did You Make This Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable?
I followed consistent naming conventions and kept functions small and focused, making the code readable and easy to maintain. The design is adaptable, allowing for future modifications like adding new features without significant changes to the existing code.
